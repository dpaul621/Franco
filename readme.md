PHASE ONE LAY OUT

"Brochure Website"

Capable of visual interaction for end user.  End user can see images/ videos of your work, and find out where to find you on social, as well as email etc.  

your design

whatever you want information you want can go up here- your social media feed- you and your brothers resume of work

no commitment

for me, this is my practice.  i need to practice building sites.  


no commitment (maybe a picture of someone breaking out of handcuffs)

low cost (maybe a picture of some one savign money? or depositing money?)

time (i can build site quickly, you know based on how much you need up there)

costs 

To get started with a website for your business, you'll need a domain name and web hosting. The cost of a domain is usually around $14.99 per year, and web hosting is around $7.99 per month. Put them together and you're looking at $110.87 per year cost to build a website.

my time is free- i will not charge you.
